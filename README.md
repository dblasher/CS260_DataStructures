# CS260_DataStructures
## Background
### This was my first real CS class and a chance to learn some C++.
At first it was pretty daunting learning new concepts and jumping into a new language, but I'm glad I challenged myself! This quickly became my favorite topic once I got a handle on pointers and an appreciation of Big O notation. My instructor followed a programming heavy approach, so my lack of discrete math knowledge was hardly a disadvantage. After bouncing between C# and Javascript, I was surprisingly pleased to be digging in to a strongly typed language.

## About
### These are my implementations of various data structures, each main.cpp file are the test drivers written by my instructor
I'll list each structure and highlight any files with borrowed code (looking at you weighted graph)
